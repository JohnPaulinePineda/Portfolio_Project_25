This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_25/) explores the various density-based clustering algorithms for identifying multivariate outliers. Methods applied in the analysis to cluster points and detect outliers from high dimensional data included the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise, Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure, Jarvis-Patrick Clustering and Shared Nearest Neighbor Clustering algorithms. The different clustering algorithms were subjectively evaluated based on their capability to effectively capture the latent characteristics between the different resulting clusters. In addition, the values for the outlier detection rate and Rand index obtained for each algorithm were also assessed for an objective comparison of their clustering performance.
